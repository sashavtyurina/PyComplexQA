# PyQA/Fall2016

This folder is designated for the PyQA project. This is planned as a clean version of previous PyQA projects, that can be found in higher level directories.

I created a separate folder for it in hope to have a well documented and well organized project.
The key features that are expected to appear are:

- documentation

- 20 words probing, instead of prev 10 words. We will be using Azure search API for that.

- I would like to move this further along, and to make a comprehensive study of similarity metrics with different parameters. Add using only question title as a query. Make use of comments that were given in the workshop paper reviews.

- I would also like to include ML methods to learn to extract question keywords.

A more detailed workflow and description is available in the code/data folders, the scripts, and in this googledoc:
