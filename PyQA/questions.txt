I would make sure you have lots of stuff for her to chew! Puppies need to gnaw on stuff all the time.

Went into shock and needed major surgery.  If it is a constant problem, surgery would be required quite often, something I couldn't afford and had to relinquish her to the vet where she was adopted and put in a controlled environment.  We go camping and couldn't control her surroundings.  I would try putting something like Tobasco or Bitter Apple on the gravel to see if your pup stops picking up the stones.  I tried to get mine to give them to me but she just swallowed them faster.  You might also set off a mouse trap in front of her, if she acts afraid, then see if placing a few around your home keeps her away from the gravel.  DO NOT TEASE with trap or any other object used to train a pup, it totally defeats the purpose, I only mention this because I know of people who do, think its funny but wonder why tricks to break a habit don't work."},{"answer":"I'd say she's just being a puppy. There's a period during a dog's life, much like a human's, called teething. They just chew and eat everything in sight.\n\nMy own dog used to eat all our slippers and regurgitate them later on.

The hardness of the rocks probably feels good on her new teeth. You probably shouldn't let her eat them though."},{"answer":"No she's just being a puppy. All puppies are idiots.

{"qtitle":"Does Cayenne hurt house plants?","answers":[{"answer":"Not that I know of.  It might if you put it directly on the leaves though.  Try it on a single leaf.  It's also said that cat's don't like citrus so maybe spray your plants with some diluted orange oil.\n\nCats like to eat greens.

It never hurt mine. The catnip idea is a good one. Place the pot where the cat is most likely to get to it. And place your plants in different spots. he may be too lazy to go after your plants with the catnip so easy to get to. Also, most pets stores and vet offices sell a product called bitter apple spray. It is made from apple skins and is very sour and bitter to animals.

{"qtitle":"How many inches should I set my html code at to create a website optimized for 800x600 viewing?","answers":[{"answer":"Tough question :)\n\nBest ideea (on my humble oppinion) is to avoid both horizontal and vertical scrolling. For horizontal is simple. Set the layout to a max of 770 pixels.\nIf you don't want vertical scrolling... it depends on viewer browser, how many extra toolbars he has, etc.\nTypically for 800x600 resolution a 430 pixel heigth will do the trick.\n\nAs 800x600 is (still) used only by approx 30% of users you should think how your layout will look also at higher resolutions.\nAt 1024x768 it will still look ok. Higher than this it will be like a column in the middle of the page or on the left side, deppending on your choice of content positioning.\n\nTry a self-adjusting approach. Use as much as possible CSS, avoid tables, keep content centered (both horizontal and vertical).\n\nSome nice browser statistics here:\nhttp://roselli.org/adrian/articles/browser_stats_2.asp\n\nCSS layouts here:\nhttp://blog.html.it/layoutgala/\n\nGood luck and let me know when your site is online!"},{"answer":"set your width to 800 pixels...don't worry about the inches stuff.\nwidth=\"800\" is all you need to do"},{"answer":"You should set it to be 779.

I think it's a little more complicated than sitting in a bathtub however, so i wouldn't try it. xD"},{"answer":"They used to do that in the 70's to get super skin tight jeans, it only works with origional pure cotton ones, most modern jeans have a lycra mix for stretchiness and that wont work, you'll just end up with wet jeans. \nIf you find some cotton only jeans make sure they are reasonably tight and get em wet then dry them on, they will shrink fit to your body shape.

{"qtitle":"My new girlfriend has kids... should I tell my friends?","answers":[{"answer":"You're obviously not comfortable telling them that matter although you know that there's nothing wrong with somebody having kids.  You don't want to be the receiving end of their gossip so don't tell them, after all, it's your life and you do what you want to do without exposing yourself to negative stories of certain people.  If you explain this to your girlfriend quite nicely, she will understand that you're not having an issue with her and I think she will understand you.  Good luck."},{"answer":"Who cares if she has kids? If you like her and enjoy her company then it shouldn't matter. And it sounds like you should start finding some new \"friends.\" If someone is going to judge you by who you hang out with, or whether or not your girlfriend has kids by someone else, then they certainly aren't friend material."},{"answer":"It's not your story to tell.\n\nAdd to that, why should you even care what your friends think about it? Go for what makes you happy.  If you keep minding what other people will say, you won't go anywhere."},{"answer":"The fact that you even had to pose this question says that you should dump these so-called friends of yours.  If knowing that you are involoved with a woman who has a few kiddies gets their attention that much, then they may need to find other things to do with their lives.  Take up a hobby!  Start a bowling league!  They just need to get a life!(And yes, it would be rude for you to tell your girl not to mention her kids.   No one--well other than really bad parents--like to hide their kids!)"},{"answer":"What should it matter if she has kids? She's had a prior relationship; so what? Her children shouldn't matter. If anything, that should give her MORE respect. It means she already has experience as a mother"},{"answer":"If you really like her, they'll find out eventually, and if they are true friends, it won't matter. Let that be the test for you"},{"answer":"Why wouldn't you tell your friends she has kids? Honey, let me tell you, your \"friends\" whether they be \"high class\" or not should not have anything negative to say about your girlfriend having kids. I have a daughter myself and I don't have a problem with getting a date but if the man is not okay with my having my child, he's not for me; not to mention, I would not hide the fact that I have her to please him or his \"high class\" friends. If they have negative things to say about her having a child/children, \"high class\" is not the term to use for them. You can't get any more low class. Use your best judgement and talk to your girlfriend about the situation. Just approach that conversation cautiously and explain to her the reasons you feel you should not mention her children, but be delicate and calm toned--that won't be the easiet subject to hit on, but if you want this relationship to go anywhere, she needs to know where you're coming from."},{"answer":"if you really love her the best thing to do is say ,\" my girlfriend has kids, and i dont mind, and if say i am stupid, then ill just have to say yes, stupid in love\""},{"answer":"Priorities seem to be an issue here and you appear to be a bit confused. Yes it would be rude to ask your girlfriend to hide the fact that she has children. Her children are part of HER and if you want to be with her, you must accept her children as well . If she's a good mother, she will resent your request and it will ruin your relationship. You probably should find a girlfriend with no children, then you wouldn't have to lie."},{"answer":"TRUST ME, YOUR MORE OF A MAN THAN THE KIDS DADDY AND YOUR FRIENDS WILL RESPECT YOU FOR WHAT YOUR DOIN, FAIR PLAY TO YOU .."},{"answer":"I would just warn her about your friends' tendencies to like to gossip and let her decide.  I have family that is the same way, so I totally understand.  About the opinions not mattering and all.  Its not that it matters, but its so much easier not to have to listen to their gossip, etc. etc.\n\nI would just let her know that there is the potential for them to cause a bit of trouble, and that if she would rather not put up with it, she may want to be selective about the personal information she discloses.  Kids and all.\n\nHowever, I am pretty sure her response will be the same as mine, which is, Why the Heck are you Hanging Out With Them Then?  -Just warning you...  :-)"},{"answer":"Maybe in this case you have to choose, your girlfriend or friends, cause their gossiping can hurt her. \n\nOr, you better tell them in advance that you care for this specific girl and that they should not be rude to her about her kids. If you don't expect them to behave how they should, you should just avoid them\n\nAnd YES, it is veeeeery rude to ask her not to mention her kids"},{"answer":"If the two of you are happy then the opinions of others should not matter.  If the topic comes up then be honest but if not then just leave it be, they are going to say whatever they want regardless.  If they are so judgemental with you are they really worth your time to begin with?"},{"answer":"you should not tell those people you hang out with if you don't want to. Those who are close to you may seem more if i should say helpful because they've got your back if they are up to it. \n\nNo, it is not rude to POLITELY ask your girlfriend not to mention the kids because if you want to prevent something from happening then you need to step up quit being so afraid and tell her but very nicely because you don't want anything to happen in your relationship!\n\n\n      If you need anything else just email me at: Babylia17@yahoo.com   hope this helps!!!!!*"},{"answer":"really up to you on that one.  Personally it should not matter.  If your friends are true friends it would not make any difference.  Its how you feel about her having children already.  If its ok with you then you should not need thier approval."},{"answer":"you should tell anyone. Dont be ashamed."},{"answer":"If your embarrassed by her, then you don't respect her enough to be in the relationship.  Who cares what other people think of her?  I know you want her to be accepted, but hiding things about her is not the way to go about it.  If you are proud of her, show it, then people won't have anything to say.  And yes, its rude to ask her not to say anything....think about your true feelings here, be fair to her."},{"answer":"If these aren't your close friends, its not their business, but even if they are it shouldn't be that important to them. Its all about how you feel about her having kids. If she is your girlfriend, you obviously see something in her. When you date a single mom, you also have to have some kind of relationship with the kids, if its serious. I wouldn't care what those people thought."},{"answer":"Very bad if you would ask your girlsfriend not to mention her children to your friend.

{"qtitle":"How often do you incorporate the breastpump in your day?For how long?","answers":[{"answer":"Try letting your husband suck it all out and spit it into a cereal bowl. Then pour some cornflakes into it to soak and preserve freshness. Freeze the cornflakes in an airtight container and rub it briskly once a decade."},{"answer":"I'm getting so turned on right now..."},{"answer":"Frequency produces more milk better than the length of time you pump. TRUST ME. Make sure you have a good pump. Not every pump is for every woman. The best kind is the hospital-grade ones from the hospital (you can rent them), that way they empty your breasts in like half the time! They are most efficient to being like the baby emptying your breast. TRUST ME get a good pump! I JUST went through exactly what you are talking about a month ago and I didn't have a good pump in time and no matter what I did my milk supply went away after a couple weeks. Also if you take the herb fenugreek (or however you spell it) it helps increase your milk supply. My lactation consultant told me that and gave me a handout--so let me assure you it is safe. But really, you need a hospital grade pump. Make sure when you pump it is not painful."},{"answer":"Da...thunderpants Maybe I can give you a hand."},{"answer":"it depends on how often you use your pump. because the more you use it the more your milk will stimulate and your milk will flow easier. you just have to keep working at it and don't give up, just keep trying. (Mother 0f 3 breastfed kids.)"},{"answer":"I used a breastpump for the first 4 months so that I could go out if needed without having to worry about breastfeeding too often. First I used a manual Avent Isis. It took me 45 minutes to express an ounce of milk. It was tiring. So then I got an electric double breastpump by Medela. It is expesive, but it works! I use it for 10 minutes and I'm done. I can express 3-5 onces from each breast. \n\nThe problem with the manual pump, especially if you are first time mom, is that it doesn't stimulate a let down. If you know how to stimulate a let down by yourself, then a manual pump will work out just fine."},{"answer":"FIRST feed your baby...a little bit on each side per feeding.  THEN, go pump out whatever milk you have left, on both sides.  The more you feed and pump, the more milk your body will (usually) produce.  It's all about supply and demand.  drink LOTS and LOTS of water through out the day....so much that you start to feel like a fish in water!  Hydration also produces milk.  If after you do this for a few days, you still don't feel like you are producing what you would like to, talk to your doctor OR go to your local health food store and enquire about remedies they can recommend to help increase your milk production.  It could also just be that you are not a big producer....not everybody is."},{"answer":"Tried a pump, it hurt like the dev*l! I used my hand to express the milk. Once you get the hang of it, it\"s really fast. Hold four fingers under breast like you are supporting it, with the thumb on the top side push towards nipple. Work from outside towards the nipple. Working around the breast. Good luck."},{"answer":"Are you just pumping while you're separated from your baby, or are you exclusively pumping instead of nursing?  If you've been nursing your baby with no problems, then it's doubtful that you're not producing enough milk.  Many women have difficulty pumping.  Remember that your baby is much more efficient at getting milk from your body than any breastpump.  Your body has to learn to produce milk for the pump.  What sort of pump are you using?  If you're going to be regularly separated from your baby (like full-time work), then ideally you should use a double electric breast pump.  You'll need to pump at least as often as your baby will nurse, for about 15-20 minutes, and you'll probably get better results if you pump both breasts simultaneously.  If you're just trying to get milk for the occasional bottle, then you could try pumping on one side while nursing your baby on the other.  Your baby will get your milk flowing and you'll probably be more successful.  Other good times to pump are first thing in the morning (your milk supply is naturally highest at night and early morning), or after taking a shower/bath (the warm water helps to stimulate your milk to let down).  You can collect milk from several pumping sessions to get enough.  Remember that a breastfed baby only needs 2-3 ounces at a time, so you don't need to \"fill\" a bottle.  If your baby is a newborn and you don't have to pump, it's probably best to just concentrate on nursing and establishing your milk supply.  You can always try to pump again in a few weeks once your milk supply is better established.  Even if you pump and immediately nurse, there will still be milk for your baby.  See the links below for lots more ideas."},{"answer":"Try drinking plenty liquids (water and juice).  It can be frustrating but hang in there.  One day I went to the mall and i could feel i was very full(that hurt feeling)because i had not feed yet and when i went and sat in the car and I filled one of the bottles that come with the pump in least than 5 mins.

In my opinion Maybelline makes great products and they are coming out with all sorts of great Light colors for people. So I would go for a light purple such as a sheer lavender with shimmer. Stay away from Glitter, young people tend to put it on and it looks ridiculous. If you want a sparkle, go for shimmer, its pretty and wont make you stand out.

Here are some natural enhancers that you could use, and still look pretty and fresh! Your eyes...well lucky you they are GREEN! A very nice deep purple shade of eyeliner, or eyeshadow could bring them out beautifully! Only line your lash line, and slightly extend out at the tips.

Then mascara black or brown and that is it for the eyes.\n\nFor lips keep them simple...because you are bringing out your eyes! Wear a gloss only! Berry shades (dark berry or wine) will look beautiful with your Brown hair, if you are cool skinned. If you are warm skinned, wear a shade of gold pink, peach or coral gloss. You will know your skin tone by tan (olive) yellow (asian) or cool (pink) undertones. This will define the shades for make up. Lastly if you want to add spark... take your front section only and add a natural blond shade throughout your curls in very fine textured highlights...(look through mags or talk to stylist) like two or three wisps only. You want it to look like the sun did it, or add a few strands of bright red highlights for a fun and daring look. You have great coloring....you dont need much!

It's the most flattering, because your face is probably young and nice enough looking that you won't need too much makeup. I used to wear lip gloss all the time when I was 13.

Experiment a bit to find the perfect shade for your skin tone."},{"answer":"No makeup would look fabulous on you. The natural and no makeup look is all the rage with youths.

{"qtitle":"Both in love beyond words...cant be together...do I let go?","answers":[{"answer":"I understand what you are going through and it is the hardest thing to do is to love someone that you can't be with. We both know that the best thing we can do is move on in life but for the hope of true love we don't. So we just enjoy the few minutes that we have with each other and hope that is enough. Love hurts in so many ways but no way can be worst then being without the one you do love. The best thing is to let go and hope that time will stop the pain."},{"answer":"If he is so in love with you, he would leave his wife and see his kids, whenever he wanted.  Alot of men and women, use their kids, to keep from hurting the ones that they are using.  If you choose to spend the next five years waiting on him, then you are the  one missing out on life.  He has a life with his wife and kids and you are put on the back burner.  If you are not that young, then get out and find someone who is not married and get on with your life.  You would really be a fool, to wait 5 years on someone, who may never leave his family for you.  If they weren't having a physical relationship, his wife would know that there is someone else in his life and if she's smart, he would ask him to leave.  Think about this, would you truth him, if he were to leave her?  If he is messing with you, while he is married, what makes you think, he wouldn't find someone else, to mess with, when and if you two get together?

Let him know your feeling towards this relationship and please understand his positions as well. I can see from your explanation that you would like, if possible, to marry him. It's okay, but make sure he feels the same way towards you. It will be so disastrous if eventually you are faced with a big disappointment afterwards. Cheers!"},{"answer":"I'm so sorry. This sounds like a very difficult situation, but something tells me that your heart is already pulling you one way or the other and you are just searching for validation. What does he say about it? Does he even want you to wait around for him or have you talked to him about it at all? I think if you do a little research into what his true feelings are and stay confident enough to listen to the little voice inside your head, you will have the answer to your question. I hope everything works out for you. I will be cheering for you all the way!"},{"answer":"For your own sanity, I would suggest ending the relationship. As much as you do love him and he may love you as well, he is holding up to his responsibilties to his family, which is commendable. Give him that much. If you two are destined to be together, it will all work out. But in 5 years or so, will you be happy with being the other woman? Are you content with that? You deserve a chance at life. If the two of you are truly meant to be together, your paths will cross when the timing is right again. It doesn't mean you have to stop loving him, but you do need to go on with your own life. \n\nThere may be someone else that steals your heart in the meantime, and you may find happiness with someone else. Who knows? But give yourself the chance at happiness as well. Living the next 5 years in suspence, waiting, wondering and not knowing, is no way to live.

{"qtitle":"Kidney Failure?","answers":[{"answer":"The protein in the urine is a symptom of the kidney failure.  Kidney failure can be caused by many things. If that cause can be taken care of, then maybe the kidney can recover.  For example, if your mom has a kidney infection, then maybe she can regain kidney function.  I have been a dialysis technician for a year, so I'm not an expert, but I know a little.  \n\nIn my time as a dialysis tech, I've seen 2 people regain kidney function.  The people it happened to, regained function after a few months on dialysis.  The longer the problem persists, the more damage is done to the kidneys, the less likely it is that function can return.\n\nIt is important to know that if your mom's kidneys cannot regain function, and she is treated with dialysis, her world has not ended.  Dialysis is a very effective life prolonging /sustaining treatment.  If your mom eats healthy, controls her fluid intake, and doesn't skip treatments, she can live a long time.  Depending on age, previous health condition, etc., people can live for another 10-15 years on dialysis.  I know people who have been on it since they were teenagers and now have grandchildren.\n\nThe important thing is to take it all one step at a time.  Listen to your doctors and NEVER stop asking questions.  Don't be afraid or embarassed to ask for second opinions. There are lots of resourves out there, like the National Kidney Foundation. The people who don't survive are generally the ones who don't care, who don't want to know anything, who don't want to follow the advice of healthcare professionals."},{"answer":"It is necessary to treat the underlying condition that is causing proteinuria. For example, when diabetes or hypertension is present, treatment involves controlling blood pressure with the use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE-I) inhibitor, like captopril (capoten®). Ace inhibitors prevent the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a substance that normally causes the veins to constrict. The result is a reduction in blood pressure. \n\nThe goal is to reduce blood pressure below 130 systolic and 80 diastolic. After bun, creatinine, and potassium are monitored for 7 to 10 days, ace inhibitors are gradually increased to avoid side effects. The degree of proteinuria is checked periodically and typically improves with every dose. \n\nIt is necessary to monitor blood sugar, salt intake, diet, and exercise."},{"answer":"water helps the kidneys. you will have to check with a doctor. what might work perfect for someone, might kill another."},{"answer":"the protein is in the urine because the kidneys arent fitlering correctly, which is the problem youre trying to correct... unfortunately, theres not much you can do outside of a transplant"}],"qid":37,"qbody":"My mother is suffering of kidney failure but she is not at the point of dialysis yet but she has too much protein in her urine.

{"qtitle":"How can I get rid of gallstones without having surgery?","answers":[{"answer":"Most gallstones are made of pure cholesterol.  You might try a diet with low fat and very low saturated fats.  Reducing the saturated fats will lower blood cholesterol and may (I'm not promising anything!) make the stones smaller.\n\nLowering your total fat intake may also help reduce or prevent pain.  Gallstones hurt because when you eat fat, the stomach senses it and tells the gallbladder to release some of the gall into the intestines to help digest the fat.  If you have stones, that squeezing is about like squeezing a handfull of pointy rocks.\n\nHowever...   I've had the surgery and it really isn't a big deal.  There is minimal scarring and the incisions aren't that much bigger than a bug bite or a medium sized zit.  \n\nIf you leave the gallstones there, they can get large enough to damage the gallbladder, with the result of a bad infection and that can cause death, which is a very Bad Thing!"},{"answer":"They now have a way of zapping them with sound that caused them to shatter instead of operating.  I don't know the details though."},{"answer":"If you really want to seek other alternatives I would look into finding a holistic store near you and maybe call and ask if they have any organic remedies.... usually a reg. doc. wont tell you those type of remedies because its not considered western medicine.... good luck"},{"answer":"Have you seen a gastroenterologist?  They can do a minimally invasive procedure called an ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography - try saying that 3 times fast!).  An ERCP won't get rid of the stones that are in the gallbladder...just the stones that are stuck in the duct leading from the GB to the small intestine.  They can make a tiny cut in the duct and pull gallstones out with a small balloon.  If the stone is too large, they have equipment that will crush the stone so it will pass freely.  \n\nI had the surgery myself about 10 years ago.  It's not as bad as you'd imagine, and you feel much better after it's over.  You might still have phantom pain for a while, but it's nowhere near as bad as the pain you started with.  \n\nEating a diet high in fat will make gallbladder disease worse, but you can't really get rid of the stones unless they pass naturally or you have them removed, either in surgery or with an ERCP."},{"answer":"The best remedy is surgury.

{"qtitle":"can you get pregnant after a tubal?","answers":[{"answer":"It's possible, but not likely. My aunt did get pregnant after ehr tubal, and had a son. Most likely though if you want more kids, you will need to have a tubal reversal. I've done a lot of research on reversal docs, feel free to IM me sometime if you want more info about reversals."},{"answer":"well probsbly not but you can pay to get then untie it cost a lot"},{"answer":"The decision for tubal ligation or having your tubes tied should be considered a permanent decision. Still, it is possible to conceive after this procedure. \n\nA recent study showed that an alarming percentage of women who had had the procedure conceived accidentally. This problem has been remedied by cutting, tying and burning the ends of the fallopian tubes. \n\nIf you want to actively reverse this there are two options. The first is to have surgery to rejoin the tubes. This does not have a very high success rate. At best, it is up to 60%. If there are any other problems, such as short remaining tubes, or other damage to them, the rates are quite low. The rate of success is decreased for women whose tubes have been burned, due to more extensive tubal damage. There is also a much greater risk of ectopic pregnancy with rejoined tubes. This is because there is often scarring and narrowing of the tubes where they are rejoined. The ovum may be too large to pass through the constricted portion, yet it can still be fertilized. Success has also been found to depend on the age of the woman, the technique of ligation, tubal length after rejoining, and if one or both tubes are rejoined. \n\nThe second option is in vitro fertilization. This also has a low success rate. It can vary with the clinic involved, but generally it is between 10-25%. It also carries the possibility of an increased risk of ovarian cancer. The woman must be given doses of female hormones to stimulate the production of several eggs in one cycle. This large dose of hormones is thought to be the cause of cancer in some women twenty or thirty years after the procedure. The studies are not yet clear on this issue, because we haven't been doing this procedure on enough people to know for certain. \n\n\n\nGOOD LUCK"},{"answer":"there is a surgical procedure where you can get your tubal reversed....It's expensive & not that effective in restoring fertility & your other alternative is in vitro which is also expensive/only partially effective, but it's worth a try."},{"answer":"Yes, but you'll have to have surgery to have them \"untied.\""}],"qid":42,"qbody":"i had a tubal 16 months ago after the birth of my son because my husband was abusive but since then i have left him and found a wonderful man we would love to have a baby togather but i want to know if its possible","yahooqid":"1006040408701","gtquery":"pregnant after tubal"}

This is a serious problem and may get worse with time.  The key is find out what is really behind his anger because it can't be his love for you.  He needs to accept responsiblity for his anger and make a choice to control it and do something about for the good of your relationship.

{"qtitle":"I need some real help with understanding Blogs?","answers":[{"answer":"Start by first reading taking notes on the blogs that you like. Think about what you like about them, their style, and most importantly, their \"voice\". Then think about who you are writing for and what your audience would like to hear from you. It might be your family or just like minded people. Or, you may just want to have a place for self-expression. Don't over think it, but have some semblence of a plan before you start. \n\nAs for the technology, I recommend trying the following (with a few pros/cons on each one). There's NO reason to have to pay for a blog, unless you want things like your own domain name or other advanced features. These are also all \"hosted\" services, which means you don't need to install any software on a server. \n\n- spaces.msn.com. This is a really simple, basic service offered by Microsoft's MSN. You can get started with the basics here and modify the look and feel whenever you like. The designs aren't the most sophisticated, but they give you a lot of options for publishing, from simply creating lists of your favorite stuff, to having a photo blog. Of course, you can also have a traditional text blog. It may be sufficient in the beginning, but depending on your level of expertise, you may outgrow it eventually. One nice benefit -- if you have a lot of MSN Messenger users in your network, you can set up a private blog that only they can access. \n\n- www.blogger.com. Owned by Google, this is also a nice simple service. The designs are great, the service is pretty basic though and lacks what I think is a key feature, categories that help organize your blog posts. I have to admit though that my personal blog is on this site, primarily because I like the templated designs and don't care that much about organizing my blog!\n\n- livejournal.com. This is a great place to host a blog if you're focused on a tight circle of friends. You can restrict views, commenting, etc. to only your circle of trusted friends. \n\n- typepad.com. This service isn't free, but it has one really nice capability which is the ability to mask the URL so that it shows your own domain. This is pretty important because if you ever want to MOVE your blog and have built up a sizable readership, you'll want to be directly people to that personal domain. Typepad starts at $4.95 a month, which is \"virtually\" free. This is a great service which I use for my professional blog. \n\nHope this helps, and blog on!"},{"answer":"Myspace is a blog and prolie editor and it free"},{"answer":"www.blogspot.com is free and I think easy to use!

But in reality most have them cut out due to not having enough room for them to grow without pushing the other teeth crooked."},{"answer":"Yes."},{"answer":"Most people get wisdom teeth removed because there's simply not enough room in their mouth for the teeth to grow in healthily.  I'm lucky in that I don't have nor have I ever had wisdom teeth - a dentist of mine joked that I was more highly evolved than most people.\n\nUsually the wisdom teeth grow in crooked or are too hard to maintain and get cavities easily - my fiance's about to get his yanked (he's 33 and has had them since about 20) because they finally started to hurt - he then noticed that one of them was basically starting to turn black . . . I guess if you can't really see them and they don't really hurt you don't realize they're going bad.  When one of them is removed the mate on the bottom must be removed as well - I'm not sure why, I think it has something to do with keeping your bite even.\n\nWisdom teeth aren't really for anything in particular - they come in during adolescence, generally, so they're called \"wisdom\" teeth because they come in when a person is becoming more of an adult.

If neither of you have credit or renter's history then you'll have to ask your parents to co-sign so remind them that it's helping them too by moving out.  If you can get a part-time job without having to pay for someone to watch your child then by all means you should totally go for it.  With the extra money you bring in, that means it'll be faster moving out.
